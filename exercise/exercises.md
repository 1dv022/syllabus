## Exercises
Exercises below are in seperate branches in the "exercise"-repo. Please watch the introduction above before continuing. In case you have multiple virtual machines running on you computer you may run in to problem doing `vagrant up`. In that case, please halt the other machines and try `vagrant up` again. 

To clean up you branch structure and remove old branches you can use the command:

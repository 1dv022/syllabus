## Code-related questions
If you have a question use the following workflow:

1) First of all ask yourself if you could get help from other students or teachers using the [course forum](#). If so, please ask the question there. You will be able to copy and paste code in to the forum so please use that opportunity. 

2) If you want to ask a question regarding your code to the supervisors make sure your code is pushed to github. Create a new Issue on github and describe your problem. Mark the issue with the label "Help wanted" and we will have a look at your problem as soon as possible. You can target a specific teacher by assigning the issue to that teacher, but we recommend you not doing so for faster help.

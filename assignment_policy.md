The student should use this validation check continuous when coding. When the students make a release of the assigment the code standard will automated be checked.

### Commits
You should work with Git and GitHub. Make commits often (several times a day) and push it to GitHub at least at the end of the day. We will track your commits and see your progression in your code development. Large code commits at the end of the assigment time could be questionable as plagiarism (see below).

Why use a build system?

The build system will do repetative tasks for us and build our system for production so that we can focus on writing code, not copy and paste files together. 

In this course we will use a build system for the following tasks:
* Checking our javascript (Using JSHint)
* Concatinat our javascript (Using Browserify)
* Uglyfing our javascript (minify/compress)
* Compiling scss to css (Using SASS)
* Setting up a local web server used to preview
* Live reload of our preview

The two most popular build systems for are Grunt and Gulp. In this course gulp will be the default option but you are free to use another build system of your choise. Have in mind though, all instructions will be written for gulp.

A CSS-precompiler lets us write code in CSS! That is right, we can use variables to store a color value so that we do not need to assign the same value over and over again. 

If that was not enought to make you see why you need to use a precompiler, concider all of those functions:
* Mixins
* dsdsds
* dsdsd
* sdsd


## SASS
For this course we will be using the CSS-precompiler SASS, but there are many more like; LESS, SDSD; SDSD;S

If you are familier with classic web development using HTML/CSS without serverside code you probebly know that adding a meny item on one page makes it so that you need to update all other html-pages with the same code. An early solution for this situation was frames. Frames let us separate a meny from the page content and made updating static sites much easier. It came with a lot of drawbacks thoug. If the goal is to have a static website and still be able to add content and updates in an easy way, static site generators is the way to go. A static site generator creates an static webpage (ie. pure html/css/javascript) from a more dynamic content. 


In this course we will use Jekyll because of its easy hosting on GitHub. You can add jekyll in a GitHub-repo and GitHub will compile and present the final result on there Github-pages.
